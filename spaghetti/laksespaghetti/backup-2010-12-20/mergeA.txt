Figure mergeA.png shows a random selection of 200 tracks from a total
of 21556 merged tracks from the standard run. The red curve gives the
average of all tracks, with white disks indicating 10 days
intervalls. For the first 60 days the mean track heads northwards, than
turns weakly southwards for 40 days before turning northwards again.
When reaching the 400 m isobaths it turns more towards northeast along
the southern flank of the Bear Island Trench. 

Comparing with the tag data in figure tag83101_smooth.png, we see some
deep dives at the end of July, after approx. 60 days. This explains
the rapid northward movement initially, the tracks has to reach deep
water fast enough. Towards the end of August and first half of
September the dives are shallower and the temperature high, allowing
(or forcing?) the tracks southwards. From the end of September there
are several deep dives forcing the tracks north again to the Bear
Island Trench.  The cooling in this period and the need to reach the
pop-up location forces the tracks towards north-east.

[**Need to check the story more clearly, print out dates along the
track and compare directly with tag data and temperatures**]
